// Lost Baggage Tracker - Linear Search Problem
// Pseudocode

START

READ T  // number of test cases

FOR each test_case from 1 to T:
    READ N  // number of conveyors

    CREATE an empty list called conveyors

    // Read baggage tags for each conveyor
    FOR i from 1 to N:
        READ the line of baggage tag numbers (space-separated)
        SPLIT the line into integers
        ADD this list to conveyors

    READ X  // the missing baggage tag number to find

    SET found = FALSE

    // Perform linear search
    FOR i from 1 to N:
        FOR each tag in conveyors[i]:
            IF tag == X:
                PRINT "Conveyor", i

    // If not found in any conveyor
    IF found == FALSE:
